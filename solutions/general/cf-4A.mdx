## Explanation

This problem can be solved without tricky algorithms.
Since the problem requires simple things, the strategy is also straightfoward.

In this problem, we need to consider about the input $w$ (1 ≤ $w$ ≤ 100) is odd or not.
Here's the simple strategy:
1. Check the number of input is odd or not with dividing the input with 2
2. In order to divide the watermelons, there should be at least two of them. Therefore, it is crucial to add "and" in the if condition.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    if (w%2==0 && w>2)
        {
            cout << "YES\n";
    } else
        {
            cout << "NO\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
