## Explanation

<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

How do we know if a specific subsegment satisfies the constraints for a given
$\texttt{mex}$?

First, to reach that value of $\texttt{mex}$, we must find subsegments which contain all
integers $0, 1, \ldots, \texttt{mex}-1$, while also not containing $\texttt{mex}$.

Then, given a subsegment, $\texttt{mex} > \texttt{med}$ will be satisfied if the length of the
subsegment is $\leq 2 \cdot \texttt{mex}$, since the median will be at most $\texttt{mex}-1$.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Combining the two ideas in Hint 1, we can first find $l$ and $r$, which represent the
indices of the left-most and right-most occurences of the numbers
$0, 1, \ldots \texttt{mex} - 1$ respectively. Then, find all subsegments that contain the
subsegment $l \ldots r$ within themselves, have length $\leq 2 \cdot \texttt{mex}$, and
do not contain $\texttt{mex}$ itself. Now, we just need to count these
subsegments efficiently.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

Let $\texttt{pos}$ be the index of $\texttt{mex}$. If we know $l$, $r$, and $\texttt{pos}$, then we can
count the subsegments for this $\texttt{mex}$ quickly.

First, if $\texttt{pos}$ is between $l$ and $r$, the number of subsegments with this
$\texttt{mex}$ is zero, since the $\texttt{mex}$ of this subsegment is greater than the $\texttt{mex}$ we
are looking for.

We need to find all subsegments that contain $l \ldots r$, that don't contain
$\texttt{pos}$. Say $\texttt{pos}>r$, since we only need to slightly change our approach for
$\texttt{pos} < l$. We can increment $r$ from $r$ to $\texttt{pos}-1$ fast enough, since each time
we increment we increase the size of our subsegment by $1$, for a maximum of $N$
times.

Considering this new bound of $r$, we can find the number of possible values of
$l$ that form a valid subsegment. We know that the $\texttt{mex}$ is correct for this
right bound of $r$ and all left bounds $\leq l$, since the original $l \ldots r$
covered $0, 1, \ldots, \texttt{mex} - 1$, and $\texttt{pos} > r$. Therefore, we just need to find
the number of\ positions $\leq l$ such that $r-l+1 \leq \texttt{mex} \cdot 2$. The lower
bound of our smallest value of $l$ is $r-\texttt{mex} \cdot 2 + 1$, which can be found by
rearranging the previous inequality. Note that if this value is negative, it
must be set to $0$. After this, we know that all values between $l$ and this
smallest $l$ are valid left bounds for our given $r$, so we can add
$l-\texttt{smallest\_l} + 1$. Again, note that if $l < \texttt{smallest\_l}$, which will happen in
the case that our bounds $l$ and $r$ are too big for our current $\texttt{mex}$, we should instead add $0$.

We can do the same if $\texttt{pos} < l$, by decrementing from $l$ to $\texttt{pos}+1$ with minimal
changes to the math.

To quickly find the next position of $\texttt{mex}$, we can store the position of each integer.


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	int test_num;
	cin >> test_num;
	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) {
		int n;
		cin >> n;

		// stores position of integer
		vector<int> pos(n);

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int x;
			cin >> x;
			pos[x] = i;
		}

		// initialize left and right bounds for mex
		int l = pos[0], r = pos[0];
		ll ans = 1;

		// mex represents the current mex l and r cover
		for (int mex = 1; mex < n; mex++) {
			int next_pos = pos[mex];

			// skip if next_pos is already between l and r
			if (l <= next_pos && next_pos <= r) { continue; }

			/*
			 * Since we can create a valid subsegment for a given mex up until
			 * size mex * 2, our max difference between l and r is mex * 2 - 1.
			 */
			int max_diff = mex * 2 - 1;

			if (next_pos < l) {
				for (; l > next_pos; l--) {
					int largest_r = min(l + max_diff, n - 1);
					// add all possible right bounds that don't change the
					// current mex
					ans += max(largest_r - r + 1, 0);
				}
			} else {
				for (; r < next_pos; r++) {
					int smallest_l = max(r - max_diff, 0);
					// add all possible left bounds that don't change the
					// current mex
					ans += max(l - smallest_l + 1, 0);
				}
			}
		}

		cout << ans << endl;
	}
}
