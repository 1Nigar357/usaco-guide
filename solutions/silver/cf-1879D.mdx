<Spoiler title = "Hint #1">

Consider processing the expression bit by bit, and evaluating the contribution 
of each bit in the answer.

<Spoiler title = "Hint #2">

The contribution of each bit is tied to the sum of lengths of all subarrays that 
have $f(l, r)$ include this bit. When would a subarray have its value of 
$f(l, r)$ include a given bit?

## Explanation

Let's try to simplify the problem. Consider processing the array bit by bit.
The $x$'th least significant bit contributes $2^x \cdot \sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} p \cdot
(r - l + 1)$ to the answer, where $p$ is the parity of this bit's occurrences. 
This is because if we perform xor on the same number an even number of times, 
the xor operations will evenly cancel out. Because of this, it becomes apparent 
that we need to find the sum of subarray lengths for all subarrays that have this 
bit show up an odd amount of times.

For an index $i$, we want to find the sum of subarray lengths for all relevant
subarrays that end with $i$. This sum can be expressed as
$ \sum_{l=1}^{y} i-v[l]+1$, where $v$ is the set of all valid left
endpoints, and $y$ is the number of such endpoints. This expression can be
turned into $i \cdot y - \sum_{l=1}^{y}v[l]-1$, which can be calculated in
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ if we sweep from left to right.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const int MOD = 998244353;
int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	vector<int> a(n + 1); // 1 indexing simplifies the math a bit
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { cin >> a[i]; }

	ll res = 0;
    // sizeof(int) * 8 is the # of bits in an int
	for (int bit = 0; bit < sizeof(int) * 8; bit++) {
		ll len_sum = 0;                      // total subarray length sum
		vector<array<ll, 2>> parity_sum(2);  // {index sum, # of this parity}
		parity_sum[0] = {0, 1};
		parity_sum[1] = {0, 0};
		int parity = 0;

		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			if ((a[i] >> bit) & 1) { parity = (parity + 1) & 1; }
			auto [dist, occ] = parity_sum[!parity];
			len_sum = (len_sum + occ * i - dist) % MOD;
			if (len_sum < 0) { len_sum += MOD; }
			parity_sum[parity][0] += i;
			parity_sum[parity][1]++;
		}

		res = (res + len_sum * (1 << bit)) % MOD;
	}

	cout << res << endl;
}
