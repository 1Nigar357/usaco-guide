<Spoiler title = "Hint 1">

Consider processing the expression bit by bit, and evaluating the contribution
of each bit in the answer.

<Spoiler title = "Hint 2">

The contribution of each bit is tied to the sum of lengths of all subarrays that
have $f(l, r)$ include this bit. When would a subarray have its value of
$f(l, r)$ include a given bit?

<Spoiler title = "Explanation">

## Explanation

If we perform xor on the same number an even number of times,
the xor operations will evenly cancel out. Because of this, it becomes apparent
that we need to find the sum of subarray lengths for all subarrays that have
this current bit show up an odd amount of times.

For an index $i$, we want to find the sum of subarray lengths for all relevant
subarrays that end with $i$. This sum can be expressed as
$ \sum_{l=1}^{y} i-v[l]+1$, where $v$ is the set of all valid left
endpoints, and $y$ is the number of such endpoints. This expression can be
turned into $i \cdot y - \sum_{l=1}^{y}v[l]-1$, which can be calculated in
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ if we sweep from left to right.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const int MOD = 998244353;
int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	vector<int> a(n + 1);  // 1-indexing simplifies the math a bit
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { cin >> a[i]; }

	ll res = 0;
	// sizeof(int) * 8 is the # of bits in an int
	for (int bit = 0; bit < sizeof(int) * 8; bit++) {
		ll len_sum = 0;                      // total subarray length sum
		vector<array<ll, 2>> parity_sum(2);  // {index sum, # of this parity}
		parity_sum[0] = {0, 1};
		parity_sum[1] = {0, 0};
		int parity = 0;

		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			// checking if the parity of bit occurences changed
			if ((a[i] >> bit) & 1) { parity = (parity + 1) & 1; }
			// all previous prefixes we use must have opposite endpoints
			auto [dist, occ] = parity_sum[!parity];
			// evaluating all subarrays ending at index i
			len_sum = (len_sum + occ * i - dist) % MOD;
			if (len_sum < 0) { len_sum += MOD; }
			// updating the parity sums with this current index
			parity_sum[parity][0] += i;
			parity_sum[parity][1]++;
		}

		res = (res + len_sum * (1 << bit)) % MOD;
	}

	cout << res << endl;
}
