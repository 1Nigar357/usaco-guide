title: Subarray Sum I
author: Rameez Parwez

## Explanation
The idea is to maintain two pointers, `i` and `j`, which will initially point to the first array element. Pointer `j` will iterate through the array until it reaches `n`, and during this process, we will keep incrementing the sum by `arr[j]`. If the sum becomes greater than $x$, we will keep decrementing the sum by `arr[i]` and keep incrementing `i` until the sum becomes less than or equal to $x$. Finally, we will increment our result if the sum becomes equal to $x$.

## Implementation
**Time complexity:** $\mathcal{O} (n)$
