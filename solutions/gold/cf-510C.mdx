## Solution
The key idea here is to perform topological sort on the characters of the alphabet. 

We find what must come before what by comparing consecutive strings. If string $name_i$ is lexicographically less than $name_{i+1}$, we compare only the first occurence of a different letter. In other words, we take the common prefix out and compare the first letters. For example, if we are given,
```
axcd
axbe
```
We see that the common prefix is "ax", so the first pair of differing letters is 'c' and 'b'. Since "axcd" comes first, that means 'c' comes before 'b' in the desired alphabet.

In the special case that one word is the prefix of the other such as the case with,
```
abc
abcde
```
We just check whether the second (lexicographically greater) string is longer as is supposed to be the case according to the problem statement. If this is indeed not the case, then we can just output "Impossible".
## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n\text{ |name}_i|)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Used for topological sort
int indegree[26];
vector<int> conn[26];
vector<int> sorted;

void topological_sort() {
	queue<int> q;
	for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
		if (indegree[i] == 0) q.push(i);
	}
	while (!q.empty()) {
		int pos = q.front();
		q.pop();
		sorted.push_back(pos);
		for (auto c : conn[pos]) {
			if ((--indegree[c]) == 0) q.push(c);
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
	int n;
	// We make sure each pair of consecutive strings are in the right order
	string cur, prev;  

	/*
	 No previous string to compare the first string to, 
	 so we read it directly into prev
	*/
	cin >> n >> prev;  
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> cur;

		// Maximum length to compare
		int leng = min(prev.length(), cur.length());  
		// How long the prefix has been the same for
		int samed = 0;

		while (samed < leng) {
			if (prev[samed] != cur[samed]) {
				/*
				 As soon as we see a difference, we make sure 
				 the alphabetic follows the order presented
				*/
				int ncur = int(cur[samed]) - 97, nprev = int(prev[samed]) - 97;
				indegree[ncur] ++;
				conn[nprev].push_back(ncur);
				break;
			}
			samed ++;
		}
		/*
			If cur is a prefix of prev, then it is already impossible 
			for cur to be lexicographically more than prev
		*/
		if ((samed == leng) && (prev.length() > cur.length())) {
			cout << "Impossible" << endl;
			return 0;
		}
		prev = cur;
	}

	topological_sort();

	// If topological sort not completeable, it's impossible
	if (sorted.size() < 26) {
		cout << "Impossible" << endl;
	} else {
		// Print out numbers converted back to characters
		for (int s : sorted) { cout << char(s + 'a'); }
	}
}
```
