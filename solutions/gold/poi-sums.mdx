How can you solve the problem when $n = 2$? *Don't use Chicken McNugget Theorem!*

If we know we can make a number $x$, what other numbers will we be able to make?

<Spoiler title="Hint 3">
Building off the previous hint, consider writing numbers in terms of $x$ and $a_0$.
</Spoiler>
## Explanation
A crucial observation: if we can make a number $x$, **we can make any number $x + k\cdot a_0$**, where k is a non-negative integer. We may be tempted to rewrite this as so: if we can make $x$, we can make all $y \equiv x \mod a_0$. If this is indeed the case, we can run a simple 0/1 DP to figure out what mods we can assemble, and to answer a query $b_i$, we can simply output $\texttt{dp}[b_i \mod a_0]$. However, this solution has a flaw; try to think about why before moving on!

An issue occurs when $x > a_0$. For example, if $n = 2$ and $a = \{3, 5\}$, we
can construct 8, but we cannot construct 2, even though $2 \equiv 8 \mod a_0$.
Fortunately, this only requires a minor fix for our DP. Try to think of it
yourself, but feel free to consult the below implementation if you get stuck!

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(NA)$

Time limit is quite tight for this problem, as with $n$ going up to $5000$ and
$a_i$ going to $50000$, we end up requiring around $2.5\text{e}8$ operations.
Here are a few optimizations I had to use:

- I use a $\texttt{vis}$ array in my implementation, and clearing it on every
  iteration turned out to be too slow. So instead of simply storing true/false
  for whether an element is visisted, I stored how many times that element had
  been visited across all iterations instead, taking advantage of the fact that
  in each iteration, all elements will be visited exactly once, thus implying
  that after iteration $i$, each element should have been visited a total of $i$
  times. Another alternative is simply inverting $\texttt{vis}$ on each
  subsequent iteration: i.e. on iteration 1, false = not visited, true =
  visisted; but on iteration 2, false = visited, true = not visited; etc.
- Theoretically, all the $a_0$'s in the above editorial can be replaced with an
  arbitrary $a_i$; in fact, the condition that $a$ is sorted doesn't even
  matter. However, we choose it simply for being the smallest value, which
  marginally boosts execution time; using $a_1$ instead, however, actually
  causes TLE.
