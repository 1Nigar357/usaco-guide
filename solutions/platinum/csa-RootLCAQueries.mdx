<Spoiler title = "Hint 1">

Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the three nodes given in each query.
When will the number of possible roots be greater than zero?

</Spoiler>

<Spoiler title = "Answer to Hint 1">

The answer for a given query is only greater than zero when $c$ is on the path
from $a$ to $b$, as by definition the LCA must lie on the path from $a$ to $b$.
Now try doing a bit of casework to calculate the answer.

<Spoiler title = "Solution">

## Explanation

As noted in the hints, the LCA of $a$ and $b$ must lie on the path between these
nodes. Arbitrarily root the tree, then consider the following cases:

**Case 1: $c$ is not on the path from $a$ to $b$.**

The answer is $0$ for this case.

**Case 2: $c$ is equal to the LCA of $a$ and $b$, for our chosen root.**

Any node outside of the subtree of $c$ is a suitable root. Within the subtree of
$c$, any node whose path to node $c$ does not intersect the path from $a$ to $b$
is a suitable root.

**Case 3: $c$ is on the path from $a$ to $b$, but is not equal to the LCA of
$a$ and $b$.**

This case is handled the same way as case 2, except only nodes in the subtree
of $c$ can be possible roots.

To quickly answer queries, we use binary lifting to calculate the LCA, and
precalculate the number of nodes in each subtree to quickly remove unsuitable
subtrees from our answer.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N} + Q\log{N})$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n, q;
	cin >> n >> q;
	vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		int u, v;
		cin >> u >> v;
		adj[--u].push_back(--v);
		adj[v].push_back(u);
	}

	const int log2dist = 1 + (int)log2(n);
	vector<int> dep(n);
	vector<int> sub(n, 1);
	vector<vector<int>> lift(log2dist, vector<int>(n));
	function<void(int, int)> dfs = [&](int u, int p) {
		for (int v : adj[u]) {
			if (v == p) continue;
			dep[v] = dep[u] + 1;
			lift[0][v] = u;
			for (int p = 1; p < log2dist; p++) {
				lift[p][v] = lift[p - 1][lift[p - 1][v]];
			}
			dfs(v, u);
			sub[u] += sub[v];
		}
	};
	dfs(0, -1);

	/** @return d-th ancestor of node u */
	auto jump = [&](int u, int d) -> int {
		for (int i = log2dist - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			if ((d >> i) & 1) { u = lift[i][u]; }
		}
		return u;
	};

	/* @return the LCA of nodes a and b* */
	auto lca = [&](int a, int b) -> int {
		if (dep[a] < dep[b]) { swap(a, b); }
		a = jump(a, dep[a] - dep[b]);
		if (a == b) { return a; }
		for (int i = log2dist - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			if (lift[i][a] != lift[i][b]) {
				a = lift[i][a];
				b = lift[i][b];
			}
		}
		return lift[0][a];
	};

	/** @return the # of suitable roots */
	auto qry = [&](int a, int b, int c) -> int {
		int anc = lca(a, b);
		if (c == anc) {
			return n - sub[jump(a, dep[a] - dep[anc] - 1)] -
			       sub[jump(b, dep[b] - dep[anc] - 1)];
		}
		if (dep[c] < dep[anc]) { return 0; }
		int low = -1;  // child of c that's on the path
		for (int x : {a, b}) {
			if (jump(x, dep[x] - dep[c]) == c) {
				low = jump(x, dep[x] - dep[c] - 1);
			}
		}
		if (low == -1) { return 0; }
		return sub[c] - sub[low];
	};

	for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
		int a, b, c;
		cin >> a >> b >> c;
		cout << qry(--a, --b, --c) << "\n";
	}
}
