## Explanation

This question is simply solved through sorting algorithm.

For this question, `long long` type should be used becasue the number could be up to `10^5 * 10^6 = 10^11`.

We start by pluggin in the input value into `totalNumberOfCows` and `vector maxTuition'.

Next, we sort the 'vector maxTuition'.

There are two reasons for sorting.

First, we need to find the smallest optimal tuition, so by searching the value from the smallest to the largest, we can get the smallest optimal tuition.

Second, we could easily calculate the `currentTuition`.

Using the `for loop`, we can calculate the total tuition at the certain index i using the equation `maxTuition[i] * (totalNumberOfCows - i)`.

As we already sorted the value, we can easily know how much could at least pay the tuition which is expressed as `(totalNumberOfCows - i)`.

By comparing, we can find the largest sum of tuition with the smallest tuition, which is 'bestTuition`.


## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int totalNumberOfCows;
	long long x;
	long long maxMoney = 0;
	long long bestTuition = 0;
	cin >> totalNumberOfCows;
	// need to use long long
	vector<long long> maxTuition;
	for (int i = 0; i < totalNumberOfCows; i++) {
		cin >> x;
		maxTuition.push_back(x);
	}
	// sorting
	sort(maxTuition.begin(), maxTuition.end());
	for (int i = 0; i < totalNumberOfCows; i++) {
		/*(totalNumberOfCows - i) shows the number of cows that can pay the
		 * tuition.*/
		long long currentTuition = maxTuition[i] * (totalNumberOfCows - i);
		/* if statement used to find the biggest sum of tuition */
		if (currentTuition > maxMoney) {
			maxMoney = currentTuition;
			bestTuition = maxTuition[i];
		}
	}

	cout << maxMoney << ' ' << bestTuition << endl;
}
```
