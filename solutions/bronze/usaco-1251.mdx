## Explanation

We can solve this problem by sorting the maximum tuition rates!

There are two reasons for doing this:

1. We need to find the smallest optimal tuition, so by searching the value from the smallest to the largest, we can get the smallest optimal tuition.

2. We can easily calculate the current tuition from the current index.

As we iterate through the list, we can calculate the total tuition at an index $i$ with the equation `maxTuition[i] * (totalNumberOfCows - i)`.

Since we've already sorted the cows, we can quickly figure out how many people can pay the tuition from `totalNumberOfCows - i`. We'll take the maximum of these quantities.

Note that for this question, 64-bit integers should be used as numbers can go up to `10^5 * 10^6 = 10^11`.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int totalNumberOfCows;
	int x;
	int bestTuition = 0;
	long long maxMoney = 0;
	cin >> totalNumberOfCows;
	// need to use long long
	vector<long long> maxTuition;
	for (int i = 0; i < totalNumberOfCows; i++) {
		cin >> x;
		maxTuition.push_back(x);
	}

	sort(maxTuition.begin(), maxTuition.end());

	for (int i = 0; i < totalNumberOfCows; i++) {
		// there are (totalNumberOfCows - i) cows that can pay the tuition.
		long long currentTuition = maxTuition[i] * (totalNumberOfCows - i);
		if (currentTuition > maxMoney) {
			maxMoney = currentTuition;
			bestTuition = maxTuition[i];
		}
	}

	cout << maxMoney << ' ' << bestTuition << endl;
}
```
