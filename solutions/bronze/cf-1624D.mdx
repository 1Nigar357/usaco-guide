## Explanation

We can greedily solve this problem by first forming palindromic pairs from identical characters.
We add one pair each of the `k` palindromes we want to build, as long as we have `k` pairs available.
Once we are done adding pairs, we can still add one more character to the middle of each palindrome if there are atleast `k` individual characters remaining.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
